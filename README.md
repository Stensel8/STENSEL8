### About Me

From a young age, I've been into technology. At twelve I took apart my game console, and not long after I repaired my laptop.

That grew into a clear vision: technology should be transparent, secure, and yours. I believe in open source, privacy, and security. Outside my studies I spend time on Linux systems and open source.

I'm currently a third-year HBO-ICT student at Saxion, specializing in Cloud & Cybersecurity. Think networking, endpoint management, DevOps, Git, and automation. What drives me is taking a critical look at how things can be done differently and better.
