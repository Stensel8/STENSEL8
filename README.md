# Hi there! 👋

### About Me
My interest in technology started in 6th grade when I accidentally crashed my dad's laptop and couldn't get it working again... By age 11, I was already doing Windows reinstalls for my elementary school's janitor. Since then, I've been helping family and close friends with their tech challenges.

My focus is on **privacy**, **security**, and robust system management. I'm not a hardcore coder - I care more about building, patching, maintaining, and securing the systems behind the scenes.
