### About Me

From a young age, I've been fascinated by technology. When I was 12, I took apart my Nintendo gaming console to discover how it worked. Not long after, I repaired my father's laptop, which further fueled my passion for ICT. I'm currently studying ICT at Saxion University of Applied Sciences with a focus on Cloud & Cybersecurity, and I have in-depth knowledge of Windows and Linux systems.

At this time, I'm not open to new, unknown connections or recruitment; for business matters, you can of course contact me.

My focus is on **privacy**, **security**, and robust system management. I'm not a hardcore coder - I care more about building, patching, maintaining, and securing the systems behind the scenes.
